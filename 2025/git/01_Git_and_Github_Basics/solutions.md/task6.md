# Task 6: Explain Branching Strategies

From task 1-5 git commands which I have used are :

- For cloning the repository in out local machine i used 

            command : git clone

- For initializing a git repository i used 

            command : git init 

- For checking the status of the work i used 

           command : git status 

- For making the file unstaged I used 

          command : git add .

- For commiting the changes applied I used 

          command : git commit -m " commit message"

- For connecting github locally through remote url 

         command : git remote origin <URL>

- For setting up the URL 

        command : git remote set-url origin <URL>

- For pushing the code to GitHub

       command : git push origin <branchname>

- For fetching the code from GitHub

       command : git pull -u origin <branchname>

- For making the branch upto date for push and pull of code rebase command 

           command : git config pull.rebase false

- For checking the commit history 

         command : git log

# Why branching strategies are important 

Branching strategy help teams to managed code changes in a structured way , especially when multiple developers are working on the same project.

Key Benefits :

- Isolating features and bug fixes : 
 Developers can work on new features or bug fixes in separate branches without effecting the main code base . 

 - Facilitating parallel development :
 Multiple branches helps the team members to work on different tasks without interfering with each other . 

 - Reducing merge conflicts : 
 By organizing work in different branches and merging  regularly , the risk of large merge conflicts is reduced . 

 - Enabling effective code reviews :
 Changes can be reviewed by creating a pull requests before merging into the main branch,improving code quality and team collaboration .
