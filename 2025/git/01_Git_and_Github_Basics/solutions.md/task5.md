# Task 5: Advanced Branching and Switching

- Created a new branch feature-update and switched to that branch by using 

        command : git checkout -b feature-update


- Modified the File info.txt and Committed Changes to the new branch and further pushed to remote github repository  :

           command :git add info.txt
                    git commit -m "Feature update: Enhance info.txt with additional details"
                    git push origin feature-update


- merging the feature-update branch with master branch through creating a pull request on github
