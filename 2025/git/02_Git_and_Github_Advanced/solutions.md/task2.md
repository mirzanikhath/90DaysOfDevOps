# Task 2: Undoing Changes â€“ Reset & Revert
# Git reset :
- Moves the current branch pointer (HEAD) to different commit. 
- Can change the staging area and even your working directory . 

Types:
 - --soft : moves HEAD only -> changes stay staged 
 - --mixed : Moves HEAd and resets staging -> changes remain unstaged . 
 - --hard : Moves HEAD, resets staging and wipes chnages from working directory -> dangerous as changes are lost. 

 we use git reset when we want to rewrite history locally or unstage changes .

 # Git revert :
 - Create a new commit that undoes changes from a specific earlier commit . 
 - Safe for shared history -> doesn't remove commits but adds a "reverse" one.
 - Example : git revert <comit-hash>

 We use git revert when we have to undo changes but keep a clean, visible history .
