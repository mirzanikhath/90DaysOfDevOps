# Task 2: Undoing Changes â€“ Reset & Revert
# Git reset :
- Moves the current branch pointer (HEAD) to different commit. 
- Can change the staging area and even your working directory . 

Types:
 - --soft : moves HEAD only -> changes stay staged 
 - --mixed : Moves HEAd and resets staging -> changes remain unstaged . 
 - --hard : Moves HEAD, resets staging and wipes chnages from working directory -> dangerous as changes are lost. 

 we use git reset when we want to rewrite history locally or unstage changes .

 # Git revert :
 - Create a new commit that undoes changes from a specific earlier commit . 
 - Safe for shared history -> doesn't remove commits but adds a "reverse" one.
 - Example : git revert <comit-hash>

 We use git revert when we have to undo changes but keep a clean, visible history .

 Scenario: You accidentally committed incorrect changes and need to undo them.

 - Create and modify a file.
                    
                    command : echo "wrong code" >> wrong.txt

This command creates and prints wrong code in that new file . 
To add this file 

                  command : git add . 

to commit changes :

                 command : git commit -m " commited by mistake "


- Soft Reset (keeps changes staged).

                command : git reset --soft HEAD~1

- Mixed Reset (unstages changes but keeps files).

                command : git reset --mixed HEAD~1

- Hard Reset (removes all changes).

                command : git reset --hard HEAD~1

- Revert a commit safely.
                
                command : git revert HEAD
