# VOLUME MANAGEMENT AND DISK USAGE 
in linux , the volume and disk includes commands like df and du for checking the disk space .LVM (linux volume management) for flexible storage management allowing dynamic resizing and attaching physical disks to increase the volume .

VOLUME MANAGEMENT :

LVM (linux volume management) its a layer of  abstraction over physical disks. allowing for flexible disk management .

It allows you to create logical volumes that can span multiple physical disks, resize volumes dynamically, and take snapshots.

With LVM, you can pool physical storage into a volume group and then create logical volumes from that group, making it easier to manage and expand storage.

Advantages of LVM:

1. Flexibility: Easily resize volumes as needed without downtime.
2. Snapshotting: Create backups of volumes at specific points in time.
3. Storage Pooling: Combine multiple physical disks into a single logical volume group, simplifying management.


Components of LVM:

1. physical volumes (PV): physical disk or disk partitions.
2. volume groups (VG) : collection of physical volumes acting as pool of disk spaces.
3. logical volumes(LV): segments of volume groups which are used by the system as a partitions .

Setting Up Disk Partitions in Linux:

creating partitions is straight forward . we need to create a partition in space disk called as fdisk.formatting these partitions to a file system and mount them to make them accesible .

1. List available disks using the lsblk command to identify the disk you want to partition.
2. Launch fdisk with the command sudo fdisk /dev/sdX (replace X with your disk identifier).
3. Create a new partition by following the on-screen prompts to specify the type and size.
4. Write changes to the disk and exit fdisk.
5. Format the partition with a file system, for example, mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1.
6. Mount the partition to a directory to start using it.

Implementing Logical Volume Management (LVM)

implementing LVM involves preparing physical groups ,creating a volume groups and the defining the logical volumes in that groups.

1. Prepare Physical Volumes: Use the pvcreate command on your partitions or disks.
2. Create a Volume Group: Group multiple PVs using vgcreate.
3. Add Physical Volumes to the VG: If needed, expand your VG by adding more PVs with vgextend.
4. Create Logical Volumes: Use lvcreate to carve out LVs from your VG.
5. Format and Mount LVs: Just like with traditional partitions, format these volumes to a file system, and then mount them.

ADVANCED LVM FEATURES:

the advanced LVM features includes snapshotting , thin privisioning and LVM mirroring and striping are the most powerful tools of LVM in disk management .

1. snap shotting : the tool which helps to freeze the volume at a point . which is perfect for backups and restoring the data at the previous state .

2. thin provisioning : this tool allows to allocat disk space dynamically , reducing the wasted space and improving efficiency .

3. LVM mirroring and striping :this tools helps in mirroring volumes across multiple disks .whereas striping distributes the data across multiple disks to increase throughput .

in the real world application the disk space and volumes are used for running multiple operating system on a single computer without any database issue .Their flexibility and power adapt to diverse needs, from personal computers to enterprise servers.
